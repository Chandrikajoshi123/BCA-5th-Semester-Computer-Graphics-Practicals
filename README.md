# BCA 5th Semester – Computer Graphics Practicals

Welcome to the official repository for **Computer Graphics & Visualization (BCA 5th Semester)**.
This repository will contain all **practical codes, assignments, and exercises** for the course.

##  Repository Structure

Each student must create a folder in the repository with their **own name**. Example:

```
BCA-5thSem-ComputerGraphics-Practicals/
│
├── Student1_Name/
│   ├── Q1_pyopengl_commands.txt
│   ├── Q2_triangle.py
│   ├── Q3_line_circle.py
│   ├── Q4_visualisation.py
│   ├── Q5_dda.py
│   └── Q6_dda_points.py
│
├── Student2_Name/
│   ├── ...
│
└── README.md
```

## Rules and Instructions

1. **Create your own folder** using your full name (no spaces, use underscores if needed).
   Example: `Rahul_Sharma`

2. **Do not edit or delete other students’ folders/files.**

3. Each question must be saved as a **separate file**.

   * Python codes → `.py` files
   * Short answers or theory → `.txt` or `.md` files

4. File naming convention:

   * Use `Q1_`, `Q2_`, etc., as a prefix to match the question number.
   * Example: `Q2_triangle.py`

5. Push your work regularly after completing each practical.

6. You may update your own folder if improvements are made, but **do not overwrite old work** — keep versions.

7. Follow proper coding standards:

   * Use meaningful variable names
   * Add comments in your code
   * Maintain indentation and formatting

8. Use `git commit -m "Your message"` with a clear message when updating your work.
